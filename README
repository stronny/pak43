PaK43
-----
The git-based package manager for publishing static sites.

All the fancy stuff is planned for future versions. All it can do now
is clone some git repo and copy all the files to a specified location.
It keeps track of the files and dirs though so you can easily remove
the copied files and publish another revision. More to come!
